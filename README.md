## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through
    the form
-   Receive validation errors if:
    -   Any field is empty when the form is submitted
    -   The day number is not between 1-31
    -   The month number is not between 1-12
    -   The year is in the future
    -   The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
-   View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen
    size
-   See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
-   **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form
    is submitted
